This is my first webpage that I created with basic knowledge of React Js in this I follow 4 steps to create a new project in VS code using npm :
step-1  npm create-react-app myapp
step-2  npm init react-app myapp
step-3  cd myapp
step-4 npm start
after this we create all inbuild modules and packages of react and start this project on development mode
